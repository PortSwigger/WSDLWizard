<p>This extension scans a target server for WSDL files.</p>
<p>After performing normal mapping of an application's content, right click on 
the relevant target in the site map, and choose &quot;Scan for WSDL files&quot; from the 
context menu. The extension will search the already discovered contents for URLs 
with the .wsdl file extension, and also try to guess the locations of any 
additional WSDL files based on the file names known to be in use.</p>
<p>The results of the scanning appear within the extension's output tab in the 
Burp Extender tool.</p>
